# My Adorable Compiler "Grooty"

![grooty](docs/grooty.jpeg)

Small compiler written in Python based on Austin Z. Henley's
[blog](https://austinhenley.com/blog/teenytinycompiler1.html).

Studying purpose only :)

## TODO:
From original blog there are some TODOs from author:
- [ ] Parentheses for expressions
- [ ] Logical operators (and, or, not)
- [ ] ELSE IF and ELSE
- [ ] FOR loop
- [ ] Number literals written in binary, hex, and octal
- [ ] Better compiler errors (e.g., what line the error occurred)
- [ ] Allow multiple code files
- [ ] Functions with parameters and return values
- [ ] Lexical scope (see scope)
- [ ] Standard library (e.g., file operations)
- [ ] Abstract syntax tree representation
- [ ] More primitive types (e.g., integer, strings, boolean)
- [ ] Arrays
- [ ] Record types (i.e., structs or tuples)
- [ ] Type checking (see type systems)
- [ ] Compiler optimizations (e.g., constant folding)
- [ ] Test cases for the compiler (see unit testing and test-driven development)
